<li><h3>Compare Salaries of Batsmen with The Average Runs They Score per Game</h3></li>
<br>Cricket is easily the most popular game in India. You can use your knowledge of machine learning in this simple yet exciting project where you’ll plot the relationship between the salaries of batsmen and the average runs they score in every game. Our cricketers are among some of the highest-earning athletes in the world. Working on this project would help you find out how much their batting averages are responsible for their earnings. 

If you’re a beginner, you can start with one team and check the salaries of its batsmen. On the other hand, if you want to take it a step further, you can consider multiple teams (Australia, England, South Africa, etc.) and check the salaries of their batsmen too. 
<li><h3>Compare the Dates in a Month with the Monthly Salary  </h3></li>
<br>This project explores the application of machine learning in human resources and management. It is among the beginner-level linear regression projects, so if you haven’t worked on such a project before, then you can start with this one. Here, you’ll take the dates present in a month and compare it with the monthly salary.

After you’ve established the relationship between the two variables, you can explore if the current wage is optimal or not. You can choose any career and find its average salary to select as the independent variable. You can make this project more challenging by discussing many other jobs apart from the original one.
<li><h3>Compare Average Global Temperatures and Levels of Pollution </h3></li>
<br>
Pollution and its impact on the environment is a prominent topic of discussion. The recent pandemic has also shown us how we can still save our environment. You can use your machine learning skills in this field too. This project would help you in understanding how machine learning can solve the various problems present in this domain as well.

Here, you’d take the average global temperatures in several years and compare them with the level of pollution that happened in that duration. Creating a linear regression model on this topic is easy and wouldn’t take a lot of effort. However, it’ll surely help you in trying out your machine learning skills.
