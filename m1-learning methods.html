		<h3>Supervised learning, as the name indicates, has the presence of a supervisor as a teacher. Basically supervised learning is when we teach or train the machine using data that is well labeled. Which means some data is already tagged with the correct answer. After that, the machine is provided with a new set of examples(data) so that the supervised learning algorithm analyses the training data(set of training examples) and produces a correct outcome from labeled data. 

</h3>
	<h3>For instance, suppose you are given a basket filled with different kinds of fruits. Now the first step is to train the machine with all different fruits one by one like this: 
</h3>
		<div id="one">
		<ul>
			<li><h3>If the shape of the object is rounded and has a depression at the top, is red in color, then it will be labeled as –Apple.
</h3></li>
			<li><h3>If the shape of the object is a long curving cylinder having Green-Yellow color, then it will be labeled as –Banana.</h3></li>
		</ul>
		</div>
		<h3>Now suppose after training the data, you have given a new separate fruit, say Banana from the basket, and asked to identify it.</h3> 
		<div id="bar1">
			<img class="fl"src="input.png" height="100" width="200">
			<img class="f1"src="banana.png" height="100" width="120">
			<img class="f1" id="banana"src="arrow.png" height="100" width="100">
			<img id="banana"src="question.png" height="100" width="100">
		</div>
		<h3>Since the machine has already learned the things from previous data and this time have to use it wisely. It will first classify the fruit with its shape and color and would confirm the fruit name as BANANA and put it in the Banana category. Thus the machine learns the things from training data(basket containing fruits) and then applies the knowledge to test data(new fruit). </h3>
		<h3>Supervised learning classified into two categories of algorithms: </h3>
		<div id="one">
		<ol>
		<li><h3>Regression</h3></li>
		<li><h3>Classification</h3></li>

				//responsiveVoice.speak("Unsupervised learning is the training of a machine using information that is neither classified nor labeled and allowing the algorithm to act on that information without guidance. Here the task of the machine is to group unsorted information according to similarities, patterns, and differences without any prior training of data. Unlike supervised learning, no teacher is provided that means no training will be given to the machine. Therefore the machine is restricted to find the hidden structure in unlabeled data by itself.
