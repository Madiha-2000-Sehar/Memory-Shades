	<h3>Now, Let's build a model that predicts the house value in $'s based on certain parameters like No of rooms, Crime ratio and so on</h3>
	<h3>To do this we will have the data set already available online, so we will download it and use this data set for building the model</h3>
	<h3>To begin with we must firstly, import all the necessary packages</h3>
	<img src="import.jpg">
	<h3>After the importing, we will load the data set using pandas</h3>
	<img src="load.jpg">
	<h3>Now lets see the first five rows of the dataset</h3>
	<img src="dataset.jpg">
	<h3>let's view our data and grab few insights for the same</h3>
	<img src="eda.jpg">
	<h3>let's see the output of the above code snippet</h3>
	<img src="heatmap.jpg">
	<h3>Now, from the heatmap we understand that the rm is highly correlated with medv which is the target variable</h3>
	<h3>so therefore our dependent varibale will be Lstat and target is medv</h3>
	<h3>Instatiate the Linear regression class and train the model</h3>
