<h3>1. Numpy</h3>
<h3>NumPy is a Python library that is the core library for scientific computing in Python. It contains a collection of tools and techniques that can be used to solve on a computer mathematical models of problems in Science and Engineering.</h3>
<h3>NumPy is a general-purpose array-processing package. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, and tools for working with these arrays.</h3>
<h3>2. seaborn</h3>
<h3>Seaborn is a library for making statistical graphics in Python. It builds on top of matplotlib and integrates closely with pandas data structures.</h3>
<h3>Seaborn helps you explore and understand your data. Its plotting functions operate on dataframes and arrays containing whole datasets and internally perform the necessary semantic mapping and statistical aggregation to produce informative plots. Its dataset-oriented, declarative API lets you focus on what the different elements of your plots mean, rather than on the details of how to draw them.</h3>
<h3>3. Pandas</h3>
<h3>pandas is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with “relational” or “labeled” data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real-world data analysis in Python.</h3>
<h3>4. Matplotlib</h3>
<h3>Matplotlib produces publication-quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms. Matplotlib can be used in Python scripts, the Python and IPython shell, web application servers, and various graphical user interface toolkits</h3>
<h3>Now let's take a look at the below video, which gives practical implementation of the packages</h3>
